# descriptions-sources

Sources of descriptions, sometimes with conversion scripts. Included only for
reference, not used for generating the docs.

* `01 ntinternals` - An unformatted archive of undocumented.ntinternals.net. Was
  used for the initial descriptions, but was later replaced with the archive
  below.

* `02 undocumented.ntinternals.net` - A chm archive of
  undocumented.ntinternals.net. Used for the initial descriptions as a better
  alternative to the above archive.
